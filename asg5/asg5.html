            <p>
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
                Oh my! <p>
                </p>
                Oh no! 
                <p>
                </p>The hyperdrive is malfunctioning for the 89th time and every favorite character you know and love are all carbonated and held captive in Jaba the Hutt's predatory, grotesque hole on Tatooine. 
                Have no fear while you approach the Death Star because R2D2 will fix it in time to hyperlaunch into safety while C3PO wines and moans relentlessly. Do not mind the blinking red, emergency lights. 
                They flash like that when it is time to party!!! Woo! 
                Also, Darth Jar Jar Binks is here for emotional support, in the rare case you are lasered and destroyed. You will hear "Mesa darkside! Mesa no likey the light" echo repeatedly as you float into space. 
            </p>
            <p>
            </p>
            <h3>Notes:</h3>
            <p> Notice my wonderfully cylindrical table next to a pair of masterfully constructed, textured, cube benches which are just out of the viewline of the spherical Death Star. There are also a multitude of other shapes (>32) and many of them rotate 45 to 360 degrees. 
                If you utilize the camera with perspective projection and orbit controls to look towards the textured 3D models of R2D2 and C3PO (using obj files), you can see all three light sources (ambient, point and directional light) all colored differently for your viewing pleasure.
                In more detail, you may use the mouse scroll to zoom in/out, hold right click to move the eye or hold single click to move the at location. The skybox of the scene models the floor plan of the millenium falcon and if Han Solo never gets un-carbonated you may keep it and customize the 
                ship to your liking. Also if you zoom out far enough you will see both the Death Star and Millenium Falcon disappear into a dark fog-like space. Billboards above the 3D clasic character heads show their current dialogue in the form of captions. Upon C3PO and R2D2, there are visible shadows cast.
                I truly appreciate all of your effort this quarter!
